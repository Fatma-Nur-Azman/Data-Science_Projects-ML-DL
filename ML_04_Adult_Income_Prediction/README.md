# Adult Income Prediction Project üíºüí∞

Welcome to the Adult Income Prediction project! This project uses machine learning techniques to classify individuals' income levels based on demographic and employment-related attributes. The goal is to predict whether a person earns more than $50K a year.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA section includes:
- **Understanding The Data:** Basic statistics and distribution analysis.
- **Handling Missing Values:** Imputing or removing missing values.
- **Detection of Outliers:** Identifying and handling outliers in the data.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Exploring the relationships between different numerical features.

## Feature Engineering

Various feature engineering steps were performed, such as:
- **Categorical Features:** Encoding categorical variables using OneHotEncoder and OrdinalEncoder.
- **Numerical Features:** Scaling numerical variables using StandardScaler.
- **Feature Creation:** Creating new features from existing ones to enhance model performance.


## Models

### Logistic Regression
A Logistic Regression model was built and optimized using GridSearchCV to predict the income level. The model was evaluated using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
A KNN model was applied, and the optimal number of neighbors was selected using the Elbow Method. The model was evaluated with similar metrics as Logistic Regression.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
The SVM model was trained using different kernels, and hyperparameters were tuned using GridSearchCV. Performance metrics include confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.

## Model Comparison

The performance of all models was compared based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results were visualized using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.

## Conclusion

The project concludes by summarizing the performance of each model and discussing potential improvements and future work.
