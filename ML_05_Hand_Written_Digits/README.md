## Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Pen-Based Recognition of Handwritten Digits
- **Classes**: 10 (Digits 0-9)
- **Number of Samples**: 10,992 rows
- **Number of Features**: 16 input features representing the x and y coordinates of handwritten digits


##  📈 Model Performance

🧠 Support Vector Machine (SVM): Achieved 99% accuracy with a near-perfect F1 score.Best suited for this classification task due to its ability to handle complex data patterns.

🧠 Decision Tree: Balanced accuracy with interpretability but showed signs of overfitting.Provided clear decision-making logic but needed regularization.

🧠 Random Forest: Delivered a 99% accuracy with excellent performance across all classes.A powerful model, balancing accuracy and generalizability.
