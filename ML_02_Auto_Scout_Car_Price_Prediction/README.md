## Introduction

This project provides an in-depth analysis of car prices using a dataset from Auto Scout. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and applying different regression models to predict car prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `final_scout_not_dummy.csv`, which contains various features related to cars listed on Auto Scout.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA section of the project involves:
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and data transformations.
- Visualization: Plotting various features to understand their distribution and relationships.
- Statistical Analysis: Summarizing data to extract meaningful insights.

### Understanding The Data

Understanding the basic features and distributions in the dataset.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Initial exploration of the dataset and preliminary observations.

### Detection of Outliers

Identification and management of outliers in the dataset.

### Correlation

Examining relationships between features.

### Encoding

Converting categorical data into numerical data.

### Feature Selection (ANOVA)

Selecting important features using ANOVA method.

## Models

Different regression models applied to predict car prices:
- **Linear Regression Model**
- **Ridge Regression Model**
- **Lasso Regression Model**
- **Elastic-Net Regression Model**
- **Lasso Regression Model (Without Outliers)**
## Feature Importance

Ranking the importance of features used in the models.

## Customer Regression Model

Creating a custom regression model for specific needs.

## Compare Models Performance

Comparing the performance of different models.

## Final Model and Model Deployment

Selecting and deploying the best model.

## Prediction

Making price predictions with the selected model.

## Conclusion

Evaluating the overall results of the project.
