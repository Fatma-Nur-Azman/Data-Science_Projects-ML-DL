# EDA Projects

Welcome to the EDA Projects repository! I've been working on various Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects and decided to share them with the community. These projects cover a wide range of datasets and analyses, aiming to provide insights and findings from the data.

Exploratory Data Analysis is like searching for a pearl within an oyster. Just as a diver must carefully open many oysters to find the hidden pearls, a data analyst must sift through vast amounts of raw data to uncover valuable insights. Each data point is like a grain of sand, seemingly insignificant on its own, but when examined through the lens of EDA, patterns and relationships begin to emerge. Through this process, the analyst polishes and refines the data, transforming it into clear and actionable insights, much like how a pearl is revealed from within the rough exterior of an oyster.


## Project Overview
