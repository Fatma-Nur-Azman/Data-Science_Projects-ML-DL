## Project Overview

 Project Overview In this notebook, I used a custom-trained YOLOv11 model to detect objects in an indoor environment using the video linked below:

--**Object Recognition and Project Goal:**
1. Project Goal:
In this project, we aimed to analyze the interactions between people and furniture to create safer and more usable spaces.
The first step was the Object Recognition Phase, where we ensured that indoor furniture and other objects were correctly identified. These recognition results are intended to be utilized in future projects focusing on creating secure and efficient spaces.
2. Application Area:
This object recognition system can be applied in a wide range of areas, from smart home systems to security solutions.
The main objective is to observe human interaction with furniture and to design ergonomic and functional spaces based on these observations.
