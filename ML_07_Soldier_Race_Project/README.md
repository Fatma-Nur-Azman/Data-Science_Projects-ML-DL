## 🔬 Models and Methods
- **Logistic Regression**: 
  - Provides a simple yet effective baseline for binary and multi-class classification.
  - Includes class balancing and feature scaling within a `Pipeline` for optimal preprocessing.

- **Random Forest**:
  - An ensemble-based method that aggregates predictions from multiple decision trees.
  - Reduces overfitting and improves generalization, particularly effective with unbalanced data.

- **Support Vector Machines (SVC)**:
  - Uses high-dimensional kernel transformations to achieve linear separability in complex datasets.
  - Includes GridSearchCV for tuning hyperparameters like the kernel type and regularization strength.

- **XGBoost**:
  - Gradient boosting framework designed for high performance and efficiency.
  - Handles missing data and provides regularization to prevent overfitting.
  - Applied for ethnicity prediction tasks requiring fine-tuned performance.

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Confusion Matrices to visualize classification accuracy.
  - Precision, Recall, and F1 Score for a comprehensive performance analysis.
  - ROC and Precision-Recall curves for threshold-based evaluation.
